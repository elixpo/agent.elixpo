# Mention authorization

OreoFlow is the autonomous Scout-to-merge contribution flow. It may start work
from its own bounded discovery policy without a public mention.

Public `@elixpoo` mentions use a separate deterministic gate before Steward can
call a model, acknowledge the request, dispatch Vet, or modify repository state.

| Request | Route |
|---|---|
| Trusted user in an `elixpo/*` repository | Direct repository agent |
| Trusted user on an external issue | Vet, then OreoFlow only if approved |
| Any untrusted user in `elixpo/*` | Control-repository approval issue |
| Untrusted user in a configured or already-tracked repository | Control-repository approval issue |
| Untrusted user elsewhere | One polite rejection; no work starts |
| External pull-request update not already authorized | Control-repository approval issue |

Approval requests carry `elixpoo/approval-required`. A maintainer authorizes one
source-comment fingerprint by adding `elixpoo/approved`. The approval workflow
validates both labels, the embedded source identity, and the matching pending
Gist record before posting one response. Closing the request without approval
denies it.

Implementation requests have a second, independent boundary. Trusted mentions
and autonomous Scout candidates both enter Pick → Vet. A successful Vet creates
one `oreoflow/approval-required` control issue bound to the issue revision and
run ID. Adding `oreoflow/approved` starts Solve; Vet success alone cannot mutate
the target repository. This keeps trusted nominations convenient without giving
mentions or model output direct execution authority.

The reviewed control-repository policy lives in
`.github/elixpoo-whitelist.yml`. Add external repositories under
`watched_repositories` using exact `owner/repository` names. A malformed schema,
invalid name, or case-insensitive duplicate fails closed before Steward handles
mentions.

Repository variables control trusted identities and provide an emergency
additive override:

- `ELIXPO_MENTION_TRUSTED_USERS`: comma-separated GitHub logins;
- `ELIXPO_MENTION_TRUSTED_ORGS`: comma-separated organization owners;
- `ELIXPO_MENTION_WATCHED_REPOS`: optional comma-separated watched repositories
  added to the reviewed YAML list.

The Project board and `elixpo/elixpo` Discussions remain dedicated Elixpo
control surfaces. Discussion mentions continue through their own exact-mention,
deduplication, and safety gates.
