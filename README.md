## About

**elixpoo** (`@elixpoo`) is an autonomous GitHub-contributor agent. Its complete
Scout → merge contribution lifecycle is named **OreoFlow**. OreoFlow discovers
and vets community issues, requests revision-bound maintainer admission, then
forks, solves, opens PRs, and shepherds approved work to merge. Trusted issue
nominations enter the same Vet and admission boundary. It is built as
**independent squads**, each a standalone Python module run as
a GitHub Actions workflow (runtime-agnostic: liftable to Cloudflare compute).
There is no server and no database — state lives in GitHub issues, a Project
board, and `state/*.json`. It runs in CI, not as a hosted website.

> This repository is the source for the **elixpoo** agent.

See **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** for the operating manual and
[docs/refactor_plan.md](docs/refactor_plan.md) for the full design. Active
operator references live under `docs/`, including the
[OreoFlow framework guide](docs/oreoflow-framework.md),
[ecosystem framework roadmap](docs/ecosystem-framework.md), and
[secrets setup runbook](docs/secrets-setup.md).

### Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `agents/` | independent OreoFlow, repository response, operations, and synchronization squads |
| `oreoflow/` | stable public framework API for application agents |
| `rtk/` | the token economy over Pollinations (router, budget, cache, ledger, shrinkers) |
| `lib/` | shared plumbing: github, tools, state (issues + board + json), scorer, config |
| `config/` | `models.yaml` (role→model), `languages.yaml`, `budgets.yaml` |
| `state/` | committed-back JSON ledgers |
| `prompts/` | squad prompt templates |
| `agent.elixpo/` | Next.js frontend (Cloudflare Pages) |
| `workers/` | stateless signed-webhook ingress; no D1/KV agent state |

### Develop

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"     # into venv/
cp .env.example .env.local     # fill in secrets
pytest                         # every squad is individually testable
python -m agents.scout         # run one squad
```

### Use OreoFlow as a framework

Applications install this repository as a Python package and import only the
stable `oreoflow` surface:

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/elixpo/agent.elixpo.git@v1.3.0"
```

```python
import os

from oreoflow import AgentCard, Capability, Message, Router, Task, load_models_config

router = Router(
    "my-task",
    models=load_models_config("models.yaml"),
    api_key=os.environ["POLLINATIONS_API_KEY"],
)
response = await router.call(
    role="code",
    messages=[Message(role="user", content="Write a URL validator")],
)
```

`rtk` remains the implementation package. Consumer applications should use
`oreoflow` so internal refactors do not break them. During local development,
install the sibling checkout with `pip install -e ../agent.elixpo`.

### Manual Solve test

The controlled implementation target is
[`elixpo/lixrl.com#9`](https://github.com/elixpo/lixrl.com/issues/9). It is
assigned, so test it through the explicit owned-repository boundary:

Solve and Submit exclusively use `AGENT_GITHUB_SOLVER_TOKEN`. For public
cross-owner contributions, use a classic PAT owned by the fork account with
the `public_repo` scope. Other squads continue using
`ELIXPOO_GITHUB_AGENTIC_TOKEN`.

```bash
python -m agents.vet \
  https://github.com/elixpo/lixrl.com/issues/9 \
  --owned-test --force

python -m agents.solve \
  --issue-url https://github.com/elixpo/lixrl.com/issues/9 \
  --owned-test

python -m json.tool state/solve.json
```

Solve creates/reuses the authenticated fork, checks out a fresh issue branch,
loads only relevant source and guidance, applies exact edits, runs bounded checks,
commits locally, and stops at `ready_to_submit`. Inspect the state and fork
workspace before publishing:

```bash
python -m agents.submit
python -m json.tool state/submit.json
```

Submit pushes the reviewed branch and opens the disclosed PR. Set
`ELIXPO_GITHUB_FORK_OWNER` only when the fork should belong to an account other
than the PAT owner. The target checks receive a minimal environment without the
GitHub or Pollinations credentials.
